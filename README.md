# IPL-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Ms Excel)

## Project Objective
 The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize IPL (Indian Premier League) data using Microsoft Excel to uncover meaningful insights about team and player performance, match outcomes, and overall season trends.
This dashboard aims to help users — such as analysts, cricket fans, or recruiters — easily understand key patterns and performance metrics without needing coding or advanced tools.

## Dataset used

## Question (KPI)
 Which team has won the most matches across all IPL seasons?
 Who are the top 10 batsmen with the highest total runs?
 Which bowlers have taken the most wickets in a season?
 Which IPL season had the highest total runs scored?
 What is the win percentage of each team (overall and by season)?
 Which player has won the most “Player of the Match” awards?
 How does the win rate differ between batting first and chasing?
 Does playing at home give teams a higher win ratio?
 Who are the most consistent performers (batsmen/bowlers) across seasons?
 How have team performances trended over the years 

 ## Process
 1️⃣ Data Collection
IPL data was collected from reliable sources (e.g., Kaggle or official IPL stats).
Data was saved as a .csv file and imported into Excel for analysis.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning
Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.
Fixed inconsistent team or player names.
Handled missing values (e.g., “NA” or blank cells).
Standardized date formats and match results.

3️⃣ Data Transformation
Used Power Query to load and transform raw data.
Created calculated columns such as:
Total Runs
Strike Rate
Economy Rate
Win Percentage
Merged multiple sheets/tables (matches, players, teams) for unified analysis.

4️⃣ Data Analysis
Applied Pivot Tables for summarizing team and player performance.
Generated aggregations such as:
Runs per player per season
Wins per team per year
Wickets per bowler
Filtered and grouped data for specific insights (like most consistent players).

5️⃣ Dashboard Design
Created interactive Pivot Charts, Slicers, and Timelines.
Used conditional formatting to highlight key trends.
Arranged visuals logically for quick insights:
Top-left: Team Overview
Center: Player Statistics
Bottom: Season Trends

6️⃣ Insights & Interpretation
Interpreted the visual results to identify trends:
Most successful team overall
Top batsmen & bowlers
Seasonal performance variation
Summarized the findings in a clean visual layout.
