# IPL-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Ms Excel)

## Project Objective
 The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize IPL (Indian Premier League) data using Microsoft Excel to uncover meaningful insights about team and player performance, match outcomes, and overall season trends.
This dashboard aims to help users — such as analysts, cricket fans, or recruiters — easily understand key patterns and performance metrics without needing coding or advanced tools.

## Dataset used
<a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saiprudvirajy/indian-premier-league-ipl-2008-2024"> IPL-Ball By Ball-2008-2024

## Question (KPI)
 Which team has won the most matches across all IPL seasons?
 Who are the top 10 batsmen with the highest total runs?
 Which bowlers have taken the most wickets in a season?
 Which IPL season had the highest total runs scored?
 What is the win percentage of each team (overall and by season)?
 Which player has won the most “Player of the Match” awards?
 How does the win rate differ between batting first and chasing?
 Does playing at home give teams a higher win ratio?
 Who are the most consistent performers (batsmen/bowlers) across seasons?
 How have team performances trended over the years 

 ## Process
 1️⃣ Data Collection
    IPL data was collected from reliable sources (e.g., Kaggle or official IPL stats).
    Data was saved as a .csv file and imported into Excel for analysis.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning
   Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.
   Fixed inconsistent team or player names.
   Handled missing values (e.g., “NA” or blank cells).
   Standardized date formats and match results.

3️⃣ Data Transformation
   Used Power Query to load and transform raw data.
   Created calculated columns such as:
   Total Runs
   Strike Rate
   Economy Rate
   Win Percentage
   Merged multiple sheets/tables (matches, players, teams) for unified analysis.

4️⃣ Data Analysis
   Applied Pivot Tables for summarizing team and player performance.
   Generated aggregations such as:
   Runs per player per season
   Wins per team per year
   Wickets per bowler
   Filtered and grouped data for specific insights (like most consistent players).

5️⃣ Dashboard Design
   Created interactive Pivot Charts, Slicers, and Timelines.
   Used conditional formatting to highlight key trends.
   Arranged visuals logically for quick insights:
   Top-left: Team Overview
   Center: Player Statistics
   Bottom: Season Trends

6️⃣ Insights & Interpretation
   Interpreted the visual results to identify trends:
   Most successful team overall
   Top batsmen & bowlers
   Seasonal performance variation
   Summarized the findings in a clean visual layout.

## Final Conclusion

The IPL Dashboard project successfully demonstrates how data analysis and visualization in Excel can transform raw cricket data into valuable insights.
Through this dashboard, users can easily explore team and player performances, identify winning patterns, and understand key trends across IPL seasons without complex tools or coding.
The analysis highlights:
Consistent top-performing teams and players across seasons.
How match outcomes vary depending on factors like batting order and venue.
The importance of performance metrics (like strike rate, economy, and win rate) in evaluating success.
Overall, this project shows that Excel is a powerful tool for sports analytics, allowing clear and interactive understanding of large datasets like IPL statistics.
It lays a foundation for further enhancement using Power BI, Tableau, or Python-based analysis in future projects.
